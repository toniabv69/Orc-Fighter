# Orc-Fighter
A little game I made about fighting orcs!

Notes:
- As it turned out - the game executable is getting detected as a false positive.
- The save file is easily editable - the name, level, nickname and experience are stored in .txt format.
- This project was actually born from my Python OOP introduction homework!
