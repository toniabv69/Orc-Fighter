# Orc-Fighter
A little game I made about fighting orcs!

Notes:
- As it turned out - the game executable was getting detected as a false positive.
- The save file is easily editable - the name, level, nickname and experience are stored in .txt format.
- This project was actually born from my Python OOP introduction homework!
- The class information was posted here because I'm too lazy to implement a description menu in the game :P

Changelog:

- v1.0:
Added basic moves and calculations for heroes and orcs.
Added critical hits.
Added basic text GUI.

- v1.1:
Added mana system.
Added character classes:

Swordsman:
- has slightly more HP
- has default mana.
- has more attack but less healing.
- has special move Ultimate Slash which costs more mana but deals more damage.

Healer:
- has slightly less HP

Tank:
